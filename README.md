# Netflix Content Analysis Project

ðŸ“Š **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis**  
This project analyzes Netflix content up to the year 2025 using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
It provides insights into content ratings, duration trends, genre evolution, top countries producing content, and more.
I made this project with the help of youtube channel "Coding with sagar" by understanding its concepts and logic. 
I gained knowledge about data viszualization by creating this project.
